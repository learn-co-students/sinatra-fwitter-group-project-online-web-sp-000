Protecting The Views
    You'll need to make sure that no one can create, read, edit or delete any tweets unless they're logged in.

    You'll want to create two helper methods current_user and logged_in?. You'll want to use these helper methods to block content if a user is not logged in.

    It's especially important that a user should not be able to edit or delete the tweets created by a different user. A user can only modify their own tweets.
